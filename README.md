# Simple-creative-agency-template

My first website. Iâ€™m starting my path to being a full-stack developer. My first step is the full domination of HTML and CSS.

This project is a simple template for a service business. The template was developed using HTML 5 and CSS. The objective of this exercise was to make a copy of this WordPress template; https://lester-theme.jk-studio-dev.com/

Note: This template is not animated, and I have not used libraries, frameworks, or JavaScript.
